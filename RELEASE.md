# 🚀 System Alert - Release Guide

Complete automation for building and releasing System Alert v0.1.0

## 📦 Available Release Methods

### 1. **Quick Release (Recommended)**
One command to rule them all:
```bash
./scripts/quick-release.sh
```
This will:
- ✅ Prompt for new version number
- ✅ Update Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
- ✅ Build and test everything
- ✅ Commit and tag the release
- ✅ Push to GitHub (triggers automatic CI/CD)

### 2. **Manual Release Process**
Step by step control:
```bash
# Build release package
make package

# Test the release
make test-release

# Create GitHub release (requires gh CLI)
make github-release
```

### 3. **Individual Scripts**
For fine-grained control:
```bash
# Build optimized release
./scripts/build-release.sh

# Test the binary
./scripts/test-release.sh

# Create GitHub release
./scripts/github-release.sh
```

## 🛠 Available Make Targets

```bash
make help           # Show all available targets
make build          # Build debug version
make release        # Build optimized release
make test           # Run tests
make test-release   # Test release binary
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make install        # Install locally (requires sudo)
make uninstall      # Remove from system
make package        # Create distribution package
make github-release # Create GitHub release
make all            # Build, test, and package
make dev-run        # Run development version
make release-run    # Run release version
```

## 🤖 Automated CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Triggers on: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests
   - Actions: Format check, Clippy, Tests, Build verification

2. **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Triggers on: Git tags (v*), Manual dispatch
   - Actions: Build, Test, Package, Create GitHub Release

### Automatic Release Process
When you push a tag like `v0.1.0`:
1. 🔨 GitHub Actions builds the release
2. 🧪 Runs all tests
3. 📦 Creates distribution packages
4. 🚀 Publishes GitHub release with assets
5. ✅ Ready for download!
